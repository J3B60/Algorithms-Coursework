# Algorithms-Coursework
First year university coursework that explored the Bubble sort Algorithm.

This coursework looked at Big Oh notation, predicting the Best Case Time, Worst Case Time and Average Time using psuedocode and mathematics by using Recurrence Relations and using the Gaussian Sum.

The different versions of Bubble sort in this repository correspond to different implementations that support different data types and demonstrating how each were achived in addition to just using integers. The Final Bubble sort version supports Integers, Floats, Bool, Alphabet Elements, Character Elements and String Elements which can be sorted (and Complex Elements and Mixing Elements which are demonstrated to not be able to be sorted).

Measurements of execution time where then taken to be plotted on a graph to show how the increase of the number of items in a list impacts the sort time. This can then be compared to the Big Oh notation predictions which were proved true.
